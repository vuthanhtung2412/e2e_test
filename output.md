I've always considered my campus recruiter role as something that goes beyond hiring for my company. As early career recruiters, we are the bridge between the academic and professional worlds, and our role is also to advise and guide.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to be in touch with thousands of students. If some seem ready and prepared to land the internship of their dreams, others seem a little less so, and that's perfectly okay. We've all been through that exciting but overwhelming period of looking for our first internship or job, and without guidance, feedback and valuable advice, we don't necessarily know if we're doing things right.

In this article, I wanted to share some tips on how to reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn *(or by email)* and increase the chances of getting a response.

*PS: I don't pretend to speak for all recruiters, we all have different expectations and approaches.*

Is it useful to message recruiters on LinkedIn? Does it really work?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**The answer is yes**. Will you be ghosted? Unfortunately, yes. A lot of it will be due to a lack of time (and a little to a lack of will for some, let's be honest), but you'll be ghosted because recruiters receive a huge number of messages on LinkedIn, and it's sometimes difficult to respond without encroaching on personal time.¬†Will you get replies? Fortunately, yes!

I can't guarantee that it will get you the internship in the end, but a well-formulated message sent to the right person can help you. It allows you to:

* Reiterate your motivation for a position you've seen and applied for. The recruiter will keep this in mind when reviewing your resume.
* Put yourself on the recruiter's radar and have a point of contact within the company. If it doesn't work right away, it will work later.
* Build your recruiter network

### LinkedIn vs. Email: which should you use?

One of the two but not both. I think it depends on the recruiter's personal preference, but I know I respond a little faster by email. Even if LinkedIn is part of the recruiter's stack, we may tend to procrastinate a bit more on messages received on the platform rather than by email. I don't have a strong opinion here so do what you consider is best for you - in both cases, the following tips apply!

---

Write messages that get noticed
--------------------------------

Getting a response and standing out depends largely on the quality of your message. I've listed below some of the ingredients you'll need to get your message noticed. To do so:

### Identify the best point of contact

*And with that I also mean, don't contact the whole company.*

Identifying the right point of contact will increase your chances of getting an answer. It takes a bit of research, but first contact the company's ‚Äúcampus recruiter‚Äù or the recruiter (or talent acquisition partner) if they don't have a campus recruiter, and prioritize contacting the recruiter located in the office for which you're applying. Contact only one person *(and then contact someone else a few weeks later if your first message has not been noticed)* but don't send an e-mail with the whole company bcc‚Äôed.

### Be polite

Say hello üëãüèº. You have to get straight to the point, but not too much, and not to the point of forgetting the essential.

*(Also, don't just say hello - you are unlikely to get a response. When I receive one, either I don't reply, or I always redirect to my* [*favorite website*](https://nohello.net/en/)*).*

### Keep it short

I don't have any precise statistics on the length of the ideal message, or on the time recruiters spend reading a message, but one thing's for sure: you have to assume that the recruiter will only spend a few seconds reading your message, so avoid the following:

* **Don't recap your CV:** your message will be too long and won't add any value if you just repeat what's on your resume.
* **Don't use your former company to describe yourself**. I'm not getting too involved in the ‚Äúex-company‚Äù debate, because everyone does what they want, but on a first contact, I don't really care that you're an ex-Dunder Mifflin. It doesn't differentiate you from other potential candidates.
* **Don't go through all the company's history** to say how much you like it and want to join.

**Instead, write a short message that answers the following questions:**

* Why are you reaching out?
* Why do you think you‚Äôre a good fit? (briefly mention your experience,....),
* Why do you like the company?
* Attach your resume

When we talk about being concise in an email or LinkedIn message, we immediately think of [this message](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordanschwarzenberger_look-at-this-successful-email-sent-to-snapchats-activity-7133017127468322816-RNYA/) that this student sent to the Snapchat CEO to get an internship. The email is effective, it's a good example, but there's no need to copy and paste it. Most importantly, the message should sound like you, rather than copy-pasting something that's gone viral üòä

### Think about the why of your message

Sending a message to **reiterate your motivation** after applying, to **expand your network** of recruiters or to **follow up after an event** are all excellent reasons to send your message. On the other hand, it won't have the expected effect if you contact the recruiter for the following reasons:

* **To ask ‚Äúhow you can contribute‚Äù to the company**. The question is too open-ended - it's better to apply and then it's up to you to say how you can contribute to the company.
* **To ask for a referral.** In many companies, employees are encouraged to refer people they know and can vouch for. This is a question you can ask someone from your network, for example, but not a recruiter.
* **To ask to expedite the process**. Unfortunately you're not the only candidate and wanting to bypass the process may not necessarily be the best idea. It's important to tell recruiters if you have deadlines, of course, but not necessarily in the first message you write.
* **To ask for a CV review**. If you're chatting to a recruiter, you can always ask if it's possible to look at your CV and share feedback if they don't naturally do it, but again, it's not necessarily something you should ask for on first contact. It's something that takes time and would be very difficult to do for everyone.
* **To ask "how your CV can be screened"**. It will be, it's part of the recruiter's job.

### Follow up properly and be patient

Following up is important and you will most likely have to do it. It puts your message back at the top of your interlocutor's list, but there are also a few rules to bear in mind to make sure your follow-up has the intended effect:

* If you send your message on Monday evening, don't follow up on Tuesday morning *(I've seen it more than once)*. Space out your messages by at least a week to give your interlocutor time to read them and get back to you. If you sent the message on Monday, follow up on Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.
* Follow up politely. ‚ÄúFriendly reminder‚Äù or "following up!" are not the best ways to follow up. ‚ÄúHey, I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to follow up on this. I really like the company and would love to be considered. Thanks a lot for your time‚Äù -> that's enough.
* If you feel your humor can make a difference, you can also follow up with humor. Here's a screenshot of the best follow up I have ever received. Fans of The Office will appreciate

Some examples

Finally, I'd like to share a few templates of messages I've received that I think are very good.

### Following up right after applying

```
Hey Mathieu, 

I hope you're doing well! I understand you're busy so I will try and keep it brief.

My name is Dwight, and I'm a current [...]-year student at [...] who interned as a SWE intern at [...] this past summer where I worked largely with Swift/iOS development (which I know is part of your tech stack!)

I'm strongly interested in Datadog's culture and I‚Äôve just applied to the new grad role when it came out a few days ago. I wanted to reiterate my interest and motivation.

I understand you're busy but would really appreciate your time and help to move forward! Thank you so much!

Best,

Dwight
```

### Networking

```
Hi Mathieu,

It‚Äôs great connecting with you!

I‚Äôm a bachelor student at [...] and have a deep appreciation for the work Datadog does. Although it‚Äôs too early for me to apply, I‚Äôd love to stay connected and keep Datadog in mind for next year‚Äôs recruiting season.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to staying in touch!
```

I hope you find it useful! If you have any other tips to share, don't hesitate to drop them in the comments, and if you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line, I'll be happy to answer them! üëãüèº
